# The Team Behind Reactif

The frontend space is indeed crowded, but we honestly feel the solution is still “out there”. Reactif is built by a team of engineers who share a passion for making modern web development feel effortless.

Reactif offers the right balance between the runtime size and development utilities for solving small but daily puzzles. Its API is inspired by Vue.js but it contains just the bare minimum to build a modern frontend project. Not really reinventing the wheel, but rather taking the good parts of what’s there and making the simplest tool possible.
