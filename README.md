## Features

~1000 SLOC, tiny in size, just 5 KB minified and gzipped runtime size
- Zero dependencies, no transpiler necessary, no virtual DOM
- Two-way data binding which is similar to Vue.js [Reactive System](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/reactivity.html)
- Uses an efficient native DOM diffing algorithm to [update only the things that have changed](https://s8.gifyu.com/images/diffing.gif)
- Has an "out-of-the-box" Vuex-like data store and Router
- Embeddable and perfectly suitable for small-and-tiny-sized single page applications
- Functional style (inspired by [Vue 3 Composition API](https://composition-api.vuejs.org/)) with TypeScript ready

Reactif offers the right balance between the runtime size and development utilities for solving small but daily 
puzzles. Its API is inspired by Vue.js but it contains just the bare minimum to build a modern frontend 
project. Not really reinventing the wheel, but rather taking the good parts of whatâ€™s there and making the simplest tool possible.
